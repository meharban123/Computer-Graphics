## How do I approach designing software? 

In terms of designing software my main strategy has always been to make incremental changes in my code and then test those changes until I achieve my desired result. That approach worked well for this course as there is a lot of trial and error involved with getting the positioning and scaling right for the objects. I think the main tactic that I learned from doing this course is learning how to plan a bit more and understand how my code affects the lower level processes that are occurring when my code compiles. By using this knowledge I can learn how to make my code more efficient.

## How do I approach developing programs? 

In terms of iteration, there was not a lot in terms of the main code but when we were handling animations this week I did have to use some for loops to handle collision checks. Overall my approach to developing software is to slowly introduce changes into my code and see how those changes work before adding more code. For this program I had to make several small changes to lighting and positioning in order to get the objects to appear correctly on the view space.

## How can computer science help me in reaching my goals? 

By understanding the deeper significance of GPU/CPU functions and the particular pipelines used for graphics rendering I’ve gained a more nuance understanding of the lower level functioning of my code. I’ve also gained a deeper understanding of how to use Linear Algebra (particularly transformations) to improve my code and make certain processes more efficient.
